It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential.
It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing.
A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix.
It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.
